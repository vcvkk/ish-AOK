# Release Notes Since `builds/iSH-AOK_532`

These notes summarize changes from `builds/iSH-AOK_532` intended for `builds/iSH-AOK_533`.

This is a focused release (89 commits). The headline is a **Workspace UI redesign** — a flat, ctwm-style "Modern" window manager with in-app virtual **Desktops** and a customizable **Launcher**, now the default — alongside the **64-bit (amd64) guest shedding its "experimental" framing**, all four guest roots bundled (and the on-device xz import fixed), the **MMX instruction set essentially completed** across both engines, and a handful of real crash/`SIGILL` fixes that unblock `mosh`, `chronyd`, `gpgv`, and glibc/Python 3.13 atomics.

## Highlights

- **Workspace redesign — "Modern" (ctwm-style) is now the default.** A flat, window-manager-style Workspace replaces the dock with a long-press / floating-pip **root menu**, adds in-app virtual **Desktops** (multiple desktops on a single app window — works on iPhone, no iOS multi-window required), a customizable **Launcher** of shortcuts (shell commands or built-in tools), and an **Icon Manager** window switcher. The keyboard now follows the focused window. Classic remains available in Appearance settings.
- **64-bit (amd64) guest no longer flagged "experimental."** The rootfs picker imports amd64 roots directly — no warning prompt — matching i386. (The separate engine-selection "Enable Experimental amd64 JIT" toggle is unchanged.)
- **All four guest roots are bundled, smaller, and import on device.** Alpine and Devuan, x86 and x86_64, all shipped as `xz`; the stale provisioned Alpine x86 image is replaced with a clean stock 3.23.3 minirootfs. A new minimal **Devuan 6 "Excalibur" minirootfs** (i386 + amd64) and provisioner are added. The on-device "filesystem archive could not be read" `xz`-import bug is fixed.
- **x86 instruction coverage filled out (both engines).** The MMX integer instruction set is essentially completed (unpack/pack, saturating add/sub, min/max, pavg, pmulhuw, pmaddwd, psadbw, pandn, MMX↔XMM transfers, emms), fixing `gpgv`/libgcrypt `SIGILL`s — plus amd64 `cvtsd2si`/`cvtss2si` (mosh) and 66-prefixed `movlpd`/`movhpd` stores (chronyd).
- **Two real crash fixes:** a guest-triggerable `clone()` use-after-free, and an unaligned i386 `lock cmpxchg8b` that `SIGSEGV`'d glibc / Python 3.13 64-bit atomics.
- **Kernel correctness for modern-distro boot.** `mount(2)` now handles bind mounts, `MS_MOVE`, and propagation/no-op flags (systemd); `clock_adjtime` lets `chronyd`/`ntpd` run monitor-only; the i386 table gained the new mount-API stubs — together silencing a stream of boot-console "missing syscall" spam.
- **Terminal/keyboard refinements:** opt-in "Maximize Screen Space," more accessory-bar keys (`-` `:` `!` `|`), an iPad soft-keyboard accessory-bar fix, and more compact default terminal sizes.
- **CLI now defaults to 4 emulated CPUs** so local/fakefs runs reproduce device multicore races; new `ISH_REAL_MNT` host-directory mount.

## User-Facing Changes

### Workspace — Modern Style, Desktops, and Launcher

**Modern style.** A new "Workspace Style" preference (Classic | Modern). Modern is a flat, ctwm-inspired skin — hairline window borders, a solid accent-washed focused title bar, flat controls, and a light/dark-aware flat desktop background — that applies live (from Settings, the menu, or guest `defaults`). **Modern is now the default** for new/unset installs; anyone who explicitly chose Classic keeps it. Focusing a window (tap to raise) now makes that window's terminal first responder, so the keyboard follows the active pane — a fix that also benefits Classic.

**Root menu.** In Modern the dock is hidden; a root menu replaces it, reachable by long-pressing the desktop, a floating menu pip (bottom-right), a two-finger long-press anywhere (even over a window), or each window's title-bar menu button. It routes the dock's full Terminal and Utilities menus plus New Terminal (a fresh shell each time), New System Console, Settings, New Workspace/Desktop, the Launcher, and the Icon Manager window switcher.

**In-app Desktops (virtual desktops).** Multiple virtual desktops within a single app window, switched by a two-finger horizontal swipe (with a brief "Desktop N / M" toast). Works on **every device, including iPhone** — no iOS multi-window / Split View required — and terminals keep running while their Desktop is hidden. A **Desktops applet** manages them: one row per Desktop (active highlighted, tap to jump), add/remove, and a per-Desktop lock (the first Desktop is permanently protected). "Desktops at Launch" (1–4) seeds how many open. Save → Restore is Desktop-aware: a multi-Desktop arrangement of tool windows and structure survives, and the Desktops/Launcher applets are global singletons pinned to the first Desktop.

**Launcher.** A new Launcher of user-defined shortcuts — each a name plus either a shell command (runs in a fresh terminal), an empty command (just opens a shell), or a `{token}` that opens a built-in tool (e.g. `{clock}`, `{settings}`, `{monitor}`, `{networks}`, `{llm}`). Available both as a root-menu sheet and as a persistent on-screen applet that doubles as the editor ("Edit Shortcuts," "Add Built-in…"). Edits live-sync across every open view; shortcuts and window placement persist in defaults and restore at their saved position.

**Sizing and polish.** The Desktops/Workspaces, Launcher, and Monitor applets now size themselves to their content or active style (e.g. Monitor sizes to ring vs bar gauges so the Battery/Storage row is no longer clipped). Numerous phone-specific placement/persistence fixes keep global applets on-screen across backgrounding and foregrounding instead of drifting off-screen.

### 64-bit (amd64) Guest

- Dropped the "experimental" framing from the amd64 rootfs UI: the picker subtitle, the import-confirmation prompt, the bundled-section footer, and the `ENOEXEC` boot-failure message. amd64 roots now import directly like i386, with the same actionable recovery message on failure. (The separate Settings "Enable Experimental amd64 JIT" engine toggle is left as-is.)
- amd64 `SIGILL` fixes that unblock real software — see CPU Emulation: `mosh` (`cvtsd2si`/`cvtss2si`), `chronyd` (`movlpd`/`movhpd`, `clock_adjtime`), `gpgv`/libgcrypt (MMX).

### Guest Roots and Images

- All four bundled roots (Alpine x86/x86_64, Devuan x86/x86_64) ship as `xz` and appear in the first-run picker; the bundled-root resolver now accepts any libarchive-supported extension instead of hardcoding `.tar.gz`. Net bundle is ~67 MB of rootfs / ~76 MB app, well under the 200 MB over-cellular download threshold.
- The bundled Alpine x86 image was a booted/provisioned 9.9 MB capture (apk index cache, OpenRC, strace, htop); it's replaced with the clean stock **Alpine 3.23.3** x86 minirootfs (SHA256-verified), and both Alpine images recompressed gz → xz.
- New minimal **Devuan 6 "Excalibur" minirootfs** (i386 + amd64), built reproducibly via `mmdebstrap --variant=minbase`, plus `provision-ultimate-devuan.sh` — the apt + sysvinit twin of the Alpine provisioner — now exposed at `/AOK/tools`.
- The Devuan minirootfs now bundles **busybox-static** (~2 MB) with the gap-applet tools symlinked into `/usr/bin` (`ps`, `top`, `free`, `watch`, `wget`, `less`, `killall`, …), so a bare Devuan root has working interactive/monitoring tools offline — before the provisioner runs `apt` — at parity with the busybox-based Alpine roots. Under usr-merge `dpkg` replaces each symlink with the real binary when its package installs, so busybox is a self-healing fallback rather than a shadow.
- **`xz` roots now import on device.** The iOS app's libarchive was built with `HAVE_LIBLZMA` but without `HAVE_LZMA_H`, so its `xz` reader compiled as a stub and every `.tar.xz` root failed with "The filesystem archive could not be read." Fixed by enabling the real `xz` reader against the system `liblzma` (vendored public headers), and linking `liblzma.tbd` into the app and FileProvider extension. (CLI tools link the macOS system libarchive, which has `xz`, so local `fakefsify`/`ish` tests passed and hid this.)
- The cached-roots Settings header now shows where those archives live (`/AOK/persist/roots`).

### CPU Emulation (both engines)

- **MMX completion.** Implemented the remaining common 2-byte MMX integer ops on i386 and amd64 — `punpck{l,h}{bw,wd}`/`punpckhdq`, `packsswb`/`packuswb`/`packssdw`, saturating `padd`/`psub` (signed & unsigned, byte & word), `pminub`/`pmaxub`/`pminsw`/`pmaxsw`, `pavgb`/`pavgw`, `pmulhuw`, `pmaddwd`, `psadbw` — plus `pandn` (0F DF), the MMX store + `emms` gaps (0F 7F / 0F 7E / 0F 77), and the `movq2dq`/`movdq2q` MMX↔XMM transfers. These had `SIGILL`'d MMX code (e.g. `gpgv`/libgcrypt SHA). amd64 `pmaddwd` is handled via the `#UD`-handler SSE2/MMX emulator to sidestep a JIT block-chaining bug; `maskmovq` is intentionally omitted (a masked store essentially never emitted).
- **amd64 scalar/SSE.** `cvtsd2si`/`cvtss2si` (0F 2D — round-to-nearest-even, out-of-range/NaN → integer-indefinite), fixing a `mosh-client` `SIGILL`. The 66 prefix is now accepted on `movlpd`/`movhpd` (0F 13 / 0F 17) m64 stores (they store the same low/high qword as their `movlps`/`movhps` siblings), fixing a `chronyd` `SIGILL`.
- **i386 unaligned `lock cmpxchg8b`.** The aarch64 exclusive-load gadget requires 8-byte alignment, but x86 permits unaligned `LOCK` operands and the i386 ABI 4-aligns 64-bit fields, so glibc / Python 3.13 atomics routinely landed on a 4-aligned address and `SIGSEGV`'d. It now falls back to a software-atomic helper under the global atomic lock (cross-page / `#PF`-safe, only `ZF` affected). The aligned fast path is unchanged; amd64 `cmpxchg16b` keeps its mandatory 16-byte alignment.
- **Build fix.** Added the missing x86_64-host `lahf` JIT gadget so the x86_64 emulator slice links (arm64 device/sim builds were unaffected, which hid the gap).

### Kernel and Syscalls

- **`clone()` use-after-free fixed.** A non-`CLONE_THREAD` `clone()` that failed *after* linking the new thread group into the caller's session/pgroup lists (a bad `CLONE_SETTLS` or `CLONE_*_SETTID` pointer) freed the group without unlinking it — leaving a freed node in the live, pid-rooted lists, so the next traversal (process-group signal delivery, session-exit, `kill_pg`) corrupted freed memory. Guest-triggerable. The error path now unlinks the group like the normal exit path does. New `tests/manual/clone_error_cleanup.c` regression (the buggy build hangs on the corrupted lists; the fixed build survives 512 error-path clones).
- **`mount(2)` rebuilt into Linux-style operation dispatch:** bind mounts (`MS_BIND`, sharing the source mount's backing — works for realfs and fakefs, and is transitive), `MS_MOVE`, propagation-only changes (`MS_PRIVATE`/`SHARED`/`SLAVE`/`UNBINDABLE`) accepted as no-ops, and durability/atime/symlink option flags (`MS_REC`/`MS_SYNCHRONOUS`/…) stripped rather than rejecting the whole mount. Fixes `mount --bind` and the propagation changes systemd issues at boot; genuinely-unknown flags still return `EINVAL`. New `tests/manual/mount_flags.c` regression.
- **`clock_adjtime` (i386 343/405, amd64 305).** Implemented the read-only state query: `modes=0` returns a sane undisciplined state (default tick, `STA_UNSYNC`, `TIME_ERROR`) — bit-exact vs real Linux for a clock with no NTP discipline — so `chronyd`/`ntpd` start in monitor-only mode. Any actual adjustment (`modes != 0`) stays `EPERM` (iSH can't slew the iOS clock).
- **New mount-API stubs on i386** (`open_tree`/`move_mount`/`fsopen`/`fsconfig`/`fsmount`/`fspick`, 428–433) as silent `ENOSYS`, matching amd64, so util-linux falls back to `mount(2)`. With `clock_adjtime`, this silences a stream of boot-console "missing syscall" lines.
- Resolved two stale/false-alarm refcount FIXMEs (`fs/proc`, `fs/fd`) after a Tier-2 audit — comments only, no behavior change. Enriched the unimplemented-`clone`-flags, unsupported-`futex`, `pipe2`, and unknown-mount-flag FIXMEs to decode the feature and name the requesting program (logging only), to drive the "harvest device logs → decide what to implement" strategy.

### Terminal and Keyboard

- New opt-in **"Maximize Screen Space"** (External Keyboard settings): reclaims the home-indicator strip on notched iPhones when used with an external keyboard plus "Hide with external keyboard" — a tightened reimplementation of upstream `ish-app/ish#2754` without its storyboard/whitespace churn.
- Accessory bar: added `-` `:` `!` `|` keys (shown in landscape and on iPad; hidden on iPhone portrait for space), and the whole center cluster is now centered as a unit rather than pinned by the `.` / `/` gap.
- Fixed the accessory bar vanishing on iPad portrait with the on-screen keyboard (a short soft-keyboard frame was being mistaken for a hardware keyboard; now gated on an authoritative `GameController` check).
- New default-on preference to show/hide the on-terminal settings gear and switcher buttons. New phone terminal windows fill the usable desktop or open at compact, orientation-scaled default sizes, and the resizable minimum is roughly halved.
- Fixed a dead strip at the bottom of workspace **floating terminals** on iPhone (e.g. the Session Shell) that the cursor couldn't reach: the floating window is already placed clear of the keyboard, but the keyboard-avoidance inset was applied anyway (it didn't honor `embeddedInWorkspaceWindow`, and the narrower-than-screen window tripped the "undocked keyboard" fallback).

## Known Issues

- **`futex_core` "signal restart" is flaky on-device under load** (carried over from 531; ~75–85% on a busy device, both i386 and amd64; ~0% on a quiet device, not reproducible on the macOS CLI). A `FUTEX_WAKE` that races an `SA_RESTART` signal can be lost while the waiter is mid-restart, so the restarted wait runs to its timeout. Still **deferred**: it is real-software-immune (every libc synchronization primitive changes the futex word before waking, degrading a lost wake to a harmless re-check; real Linux passes because its syscall restart is microseconds).
- The 64-bit (amd64) guest, while no longer labeled experimental in the UI, is still newer than the i386 guest and remains the less-seasoned of the two.

## Maintainer Notes

- `builds/iSH-AOK_531` points to `a3fdfb6b`; `builds/iSH-AOK_532` points to `17bd4267`. `builds/iSH-AOK_533` should point to this release-notes commit (matching the established `docs: add iSH-AOK <N> release notes` pattern).
- `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` bumped 532 → 533 in the four app configs (commit `f8189355`); the secondary target remains at 529, as in 531/532. `MARKETING_VERSION` is unchanged (`1.3`).
- Feature branches merged into `working` this cycle: `workspace-modern`, `maximize-screen-space`, `fork-clone-fix`, `mount-flags`, `clone-instrument`, `fd-proc-cleanup`.
- The emulator-level fixes (MMX completion, `cvtsd2si`/`cvtss2si`, `movlpd`/`movhpd`, unaligned `cmpxchg8b`, `clock_adjtime`, `mount`, the `clone()` UAF) were validated on an arm64 host bit-exact vs the Rosetta x86 and real-Intel "mint" Linux oracles per their commit messages; they need this app rebuild to reach the device. New guest self-checks: `mount_flags.c`, `clone_error_cleanup.c`.
- Most Workspace / iOS-app UI changes can't be compiled from the CLI here; they were static-verified and device-tested by the maintainer. The `[LAUNCHER-DIAG]` breadcrumbs added in `bf5f35b0` were removed in `91f214e9` once the Launcher foreground-displacement fix (`3689f3ce`) was confirmed on device — no diagnostic logging remains.
- Pre-tag sanity checks at this HEAD (`088ff1cc`): version bump consistent across the four app configs; working tree clean apart from this untracked notes file and a `.swp` (vim swap, not part of the release); the emulator core compiles (`ninja -C build ish` → "no work to do"); and the amd64 (`alpine64`) fakefs boots and runs (`uname -m` → `x86_64`, CPU flags present).
- Recommended at tag time: run the on-device `/AOK/tests` guest regression suite on **both** roots (i386 + amd64), as in 531.
